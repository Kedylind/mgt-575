Get ready for #Zootopia2, only in theaters November 26!

After cracking the biggest case in Zootopia’s history, rookie cops Judy Hopps (voice of Ginnifer Goodwin) and Nick Wilde (voice of Jason Bateman) find their partnership isn’t as solid as they thought when Chief Bogo (voice of Idris Elba) orders them to join the Partners in Crisis counseling program. But it doesn’t take long for their partnership to be put to the ultimate test when they find themselves on the twisting trail of a mystery tied to the arrival of a venomous snake in the animal metropolis. The trailer, poster and trailer stills are now available to download and share.
 
While “Zootopia 2” introduces Gary De’Snake (voice of Ke Huy Quan), Nibbles (voice of Fortune Feimster) and quokka therapist Dr. Fuzzby (voice of Quinta Brunson), the upcoming feature film also welcomes back a herd of characters who made their debut in the Oscar®-winning film “Zootopia.” “It’s been an absolute joy to reteam with so many actors who made the first film so special, and so exciting to expand the world with our phenomenal new cast members,” said director/writer Jared Bush (chief creative officer for Walt Disney Animation Studios). “I can’t wait for audiences to see what other surprises we have in store in this brand-new adventure.”

    transcript: 'Welcome to Partners in Crisis. I am your
therapy animal, Dr. Fuzby. Greg, we
talked about that. What are we making
Marlin? Uncomfortable.
Yes.
And Francine Clark may be a mouse, but
he is your partner first. And we have
two new partners. Can you tell us about
your journey to Dysfunction Junction?
Well, we've been official partners for
one week at the anniversary and we are
functioning fine, better than fine, and
we did sort of save the city. So, espe
kind of seems like a huge
misunderstanding.
Notice how she answered first, did not
allow her partner to speak, and taps her
foot when she's suppressing discomfort.
And observe the source of her discomfort
represented by the disconnected
affectation of her emotionally insecure
partner. Oh,
>> but for now we begin by greeting our
teammate.
>> Okay. Unfortunately, Karen has chosen to
see Joel's smile as a sign of
aggression. Hackles down. Karen. Karen.
Hackles down. Someone get the hose.
>> Bunny Fox. This is a make or break
assignment. Fail and I will split you
up.
>> No snake has set foot in Zootopia in
forever.
>> Hops and wild.
>> Wild and hops. The dream team.
Sorry, Paul.
>> 1 2 3 4
right now.
>> Stop in the name of the law. I'm really
sorry.
>> Stop pulling my ears. Stop pulling my
ears. Don't ever pull a bunny's ears. I
have to help my family. Cannonball.
[Music]
>> You know this is not your worst idea.
>> Wow, that was almost a compliment.
>> Your worst idea is what you did with
your ears.
Hey ho.'
