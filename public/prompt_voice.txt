You are choosing the best text-to-speech voice for a video narration.

Consider the following:
1) VOICE DESCRIPTIONS (each voice id and when to use it):
{voice_descriptions}

2) NARRATION INSTRUCTIONS (what the user asked for):
{instructions}

3) PRODUCT SPEC / PDF CONTENT (if any):
{pdf_content}

4) THE GENERATED NARRATION TEXT (the actual script to be spoken):
{narration_text}

5) The video frames have been provided as images so you can see the visual context.

Choose the single best voice from the voice descriptions above for this narration. Explain your choice in a short paragraph (justification).

Respond with valid JSON only, no other text or markdown. Use exactly these keys:
"voice" : one of the voice ids from the descriptions (e.g. "nova", "alloy", "shimmer")
"justification" : your short paragraph explaining why this voice fits best

Example format:
{"voice": "nova", "justification": "Your explanation here."}
